# JeTFlix Web Prototype

Welcome to the JeTFlix web prototype project! This project was created as part of a university assignment to design a user-friendly streaming service website prototype.

## Figma Prototype

You can view the interactive Figma prototype by clicking [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/MdVCY2LoGHt6jbQ2vDrnSz/JeTFlix?type=design&node-id=127-2&scaling=scale-down-width&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2). The Figma prototype serves as the foundation for our web development.

## Project Overview

JeTFlix is a fictitious streaming company, and the goal of this project was to design a website prototype that enhances user experience and convenience. Here's an overview of the project, including the web pages and their requirements:

### Web Pages

1. **Home Page**: This page shows a top movie as a background and a form to redirect to the sign-up page. It also contains information about kid's movies/profile.

2. **News & Popular Page**: This page provides information about the top 5 movies on JeTFlix, including movie information such as title, cast, and genre. It features play and download buttons for each movie.

3. **Movies Page**: This page displays a list of movie categories and their respective movies. There are four categories, each with at least five movies. The page showcases movie images and includes a jumbotron highlighting the best movie on JeTFlix. The jumbotron provides details such as the movie name, synopsis, and a button to the Detail Page.

4. **Detail Page**: This page offers a detailed description of the best movie on JeTFlix, including cast, genre, synopsis, creator, and all episodes. Each episode includes information such as an image (random clip from the episode), title, description, and duration.

5. **Sign-Up Page**: This page allows customers to register an account. Customers are required to submit personal information, including name, password, confirm password, date of birth, gender, and agree to the terms and conditions. The page includes five types of form components and five types of JavaScript-based validation (no regular expressions).

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `homepage.html`: The starting page HTML file for the JeTFlix website.
- `style/`: The directory containing external CSS files used for styling.
- `script/`: The directory containing JavaScript files for adding functionality.
- `assets/`: Store images and assets used in the project.
- `README.md`: You are here!
